  Input - maps firmware key events to UI inputs.

  Up and Home are Up, and Down and Delete are Down (Qualcomm keypads report
  the volume buttons as Up and Down), or the other way round when Reverse
  is set. Esc and Backspace are Back, and Enter, Space and SCAN_SUSPEND
  (the power key on Qualcomm keypads) are Select. Other keys are ignored.
  The input is reset after each read, so Qualcomm's keypad reports a held
  key again. Repeat and hold timing is left to the UI's key decoder
  (Ui/Ui.h).
